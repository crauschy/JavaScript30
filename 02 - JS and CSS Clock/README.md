## JS30 Project #2: JS and CSS Clock. 
#### Just wanting some low-stakes, JavaScript fun
---

I deviated from the original by changing the colors around a little and smoothing out the size and shape of the clock hands.

#### Ideas to Implement:
- [ ] Have different "theme" options, initiated by buttons
- [ ] Create a digital clock display
- [ ] Add some random alarm messages ("Happy Hour!")
- [ ] Maybe turn into some sort of meditation timer/tool
- [ ] Add a ticking sound for the second hand
